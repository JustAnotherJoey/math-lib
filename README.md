# math-ref
The purpose of this project is to serve as a complete reference and guide to most of the math that an undergraduate should expect to see. In particular, I will be doing guides for Linear Algebra, Calculus, Differential Equations, Probability and Statistics, Fourier Analysis, and Machine Learning. In particular, I will try to provide implementations of many of the most important algorithms of each subject, prove some of the most fundamental topics, and use graphs alongside quick LaTex writeups to give a good sense of how to apply concepts in a practical setting, understand why choices were made in using a particular model and algorithm to solve a problem, and to be confident that such your solution is sound or atleast understand where it falls short.

    "## Linear Systems of Equations, Vectors, and Matrices\n",
    "Before we begin our forray into linear algebra, we need to know what a matrix, vector, and linear system of equations is. We start with the vector, which is simply a collection of numbers. In symbols, we write that a vector **v** with n elements (often called an n-vector) as\n",
    "$$ \\textbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\text{ or } \\textbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{C}^n $$\n",
    "For example, we can express a 3 vector as \n",
    "$$ \\textbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\text{ or } \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 && v_2 && v_3 \\end{bmatrix}  $$\n",
    "Where each element can be a real number or complex number. Note that a 3-vector **v** can be represented by either a column vector or row vector. Vectors are often written with lowercase bold letters, which is the same convention I will try to adopt for this document. <br>\n",
    "Matrices, like vectors, are also collections of numbers, but they are organized into a rectangular table with m rows and n columns. Matrices can also be viewed as collections of vectors, and a vector can be viewed as a matrix with one row or one column. We express a 2x2 matrix **A** as\n",
    "$$ \\textbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 && a_2 \\\\ a_3 && a_4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\textbf{a}_1 && \\textbf{a}_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\textbf{a}_1^T \\\\ \\textbf{a}_2^T \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "Note that we use bold uppercase letters to represent matrices, the bold a's are column vectors, and the non-bold a's are scalar values (which can be complex valued for many important matrices). We write \n",
    "$$ \\textbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{mxn} \\text{ or } \\textbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{mxn} $$\n",
    "to denote that A belongs to the collection of real or complex matrices with m rows and n columns. <br>\n",
    "Finally, I would like to introduce the concept of a linear system of equations. A system of equations contains m equations where each equation has up to n variables. For example, a 2x2 system of equations can be written as \n",
    "$$ \\begin{align*}\n",
    "  a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+a_{13}x_3 &= \\, b_1  \\\\ \n",
    "  a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+a_{23}x_3 &= \\, b_2\\\\ \n",
    "  a_{31}x_1+a_{32}x_2+a_{33}x_3 &= \\, b_3\n",
    "\\end{align*} $$\n",
    "Alternatively, we can write \n",
    "$$ \\textbf{Ax} = \\textbf{b}$$\n",
    "where \n",
    "$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 && a_2 && a_3\\\\ a_4 && a_5 && a_6 \\\\ a_7 && a_8 && a_9 \\end{bmatrix} \\text{, } \\textbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\text{, and } \\textbf{b} = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "Thus, we see that matrices and vectors are convenient structures for solving and manipulating linear systems of equations. Linear systems of equations, vectors, and matrices obey the principle of superposition. When a system or object obeys the principle of superposition, that system or object has the property of linearity, which is defined as\n",
    "$$ f(\\alpha x + \\beta y) = \\alpha f(x) + \\beta f(y) \\text{ where } f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m \\text{ and } x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n $$\n",
    "This notation is very compact, so it is important to clarify in words what is going on here. The notation says that a function is linear iff function inputs can be scaled and added before being transformed or function inputs can be transformed, then scaled, and then added and that performing those operations in either order will yield an equivalent result.

    "Linear systems of equations are extremely relevant since they are a very natural way to model lots of different phenomanae. In particular, we are often interested in performing estimation/inversion or control/design. Put more abstractly, for a linear system that can be represented as **Ax** = **b** , we want to know what values **x** can give a desired **b** or whether **b** is a value that is reachable given the matrix **A**. In order to answer questions of this nature, we must be able to solve these systems of equations to put them in forms where we can answer these questions and provide exact values for specific systems. \n",
